#Real-Time Object Detection with OpenCV and SSD MobileNet v3
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using OpenCV and a pre-trained SSD MobileNet v3 deep learning model. It can process live video feeds from a webcam or analyze objects within a video file.

Features
Real-time Object Detection: Quickly identifies and locates objects in video streams.
SSD MobileNet v3 Architecture: Employs a powerful and efficient deep learning model for object detection.
Customizable: Easily adjust parameters like detection threshold and non-maximum suppression.
Multiple Input Sources: Supports both webcam input and video files.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy (np)
TensorFlow or other deep learning framework (if you need to fine-tune or retrain the model)

Installation

Clone the repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git

Install dependencies:
Bash
pip install opencv-python numpy

Download Model Files:
Ensure you have frozen_inference_graph.pb (model weights) and ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14.pbtxt (model configuration) in the same directory as your script. You can download them from the TensorFlow Model Zoo or other sources.
Usage
Run with Webcam:

Bash
python object_detector.py -source 1

Run with Video File:
python object_detector.py -source 0 -video_path /path/to/your/video.mp4 

Additional Arguments
-source: 0 for video file, 1 for webcam (required)
-video_path: Path to the video file (required if -source is 0)

Customization
Detection Threshold: Adjust the thresh variable in the ObjectDetection class to control the confidence level required for object detection.
Non-Maximum Suppression Threshold: Modify the nms_threshold variable to adjust how aggressively overlapping bounding boxes are suppressed.
